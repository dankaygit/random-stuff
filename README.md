### split_rename-employee-pdfs
- ** split_rename-employee-pdfs.py **

 A little script to automate splitting up pdf files with one page per employee. You need to provide one (or more) pdf files with some employee data, and an <employee.txt>file with the employee names listed in the same order as they occur in the pdf file, one employee per line.

- ** split_rename-executable.7z **

A zipped folder containing an executable file and source folder, which eliminates the need for a Python distribution (only for Windows at the moment).
