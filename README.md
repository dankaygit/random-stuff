### split_rename-employee-pdfs.py:
- A little script to automate splitting up pdf files with one page per employee. You need to provide one (or more) pdf files with some employee data, and an <employee.txt> file with the employee names listed in the same order as the occurence in the pdf file, one employee per line.
